# What is google-play-graphic-assets?
Publishing an app to the Google Play store requires completing a Store Listing that involves the upload of a few graphic assets. This project provides you with a blank version of these graphic assets so you can publish your app immediately. These graphic assets can be updated later with the right version.

# Why should I use these blank graphic assets?
You may want to use these blank graphic assets to publish an app to the store that is not production-ready. These reasons might include:
* Making an Alpha version of your app available to a test group
* Making a Beta version of your app available to a test group
* Testing In-App billing in your app

# Usage
Before an app can be published in Google Play. You need to attach the following graphic assets to the Store Listing form:
* At least 2 screenshots are required overall: JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha). Min length for any side: 320px. Max length for any side: 3840px.
* Hi-res icon: 32-bit PNG (with alpha). 512 w x 512 h.
* Feature Graphic: JPG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha). 1024 w x 500 h

The blank graphic assets in their final, ready to upload form are available in the png folder. 

You can edit the source PSD files in the psd folder with Adobe Photoshop or a compatible image editing software as the basis for designing your graphic assets.
